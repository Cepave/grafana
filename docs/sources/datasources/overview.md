# Data Source Overview
Grafana supports many different storage backends for your time series data (Data Source). Each Data Source has a specific Query Editor that is customized for the features and capabilities that the particular Data Source exposes.


## Querying
The query language and capabilities of each Data Source are obviously very different. You can combine data from multiple Data Sources onto a single Dashboard, but each Panel is tied to a specific Data Source that belongs to a particular Organization.

## Supported Data Sources
The following datasources are officially supported:

* [Graphite](/datasources/graphite/)
* [Elasticsearch](/datasources/elasticsearch/)
* [CloudWatch](/datasources/cloudwatch/)
* [InfluxDB](/datasources/influxdb/)
* [OpenTSDB](/datasources/opentsdb/)
* [KairosDB](/datasources/kairosdb)
* [Prometheus](/datasources/prometheus)
